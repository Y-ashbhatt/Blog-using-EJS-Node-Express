# Blog Web Application
> This project is a simple blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. No database is used in this version, so posts do not persist between sessions.

## Features
- Post Creation: Users can create new blog posts via a form on the homepage.
- Post Viewing: Users can view all posts on the homepage.
- Post Edit/Delete: Users can edit or delete existing posts.
- Responsive Design: The application is styled to be responsive and provide a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

 ## Technical Requirements
- Node.js & Express.js: The app is built using Node.js and Express.js for routing and middleware.
- EJS: The templating engine used for dynamic HTML generation.
- CSS: Used for styling the front end of the application, ensuring a responsive design.

## What I Learned
This project taught me several valuable skills:

- Node.js and Express Basics: I learned how to set up a basic web server using Node.js and Express.js, how to manage routes, and how to handle user input from forms.
- Templating with EJS: I understood how to generate dynamic HTML using EJS, which allows me to insert data into templates and manage front-end content more efficiently.
- Handling Data without a Database: Since the project doesnâ€™t use a database, I learned to temporarily store and manage data in-memory (within the server). This gave me insight into handling basic data operations without persistence.
- Responsive Design: I deepened my understanding of CSS, specifically in creating responsive designs that look good on both desktop and mobile devices. This included learning about media queries, Flexbox, and basic Grid layouts.
- Routing & URL Parameters: I learned how to pass parameters in the URL for editing and deleting posts, which provided an understanding of how routing works in Express.js.
- Project Structuring: I improved my ability to structure a Node.js project with clear separation between views, routes, static files, and logic.

## Future Enhancements
- Add user authentication for personalized blog posts.
- Add a database (MongoDB) to store blog posts permanently.
- Enhance the UI with more modern design elements.
- Add rich text editor for creating posts.
